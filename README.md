# Laraval-env-file-update-
Update your laravel .env file 


I was looking for a way to change the .env-values within a controller or from something else. I found nothing, so I created my own little method. It takes an array of new values. The array key must be the key from the .env. The script overwrites the old .env. Yet not perfect, but works for now
